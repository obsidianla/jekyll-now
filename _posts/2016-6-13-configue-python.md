title: How to configure the ecoPython system
---
  This is my first blog. I plan to write a crawler using python.
  
  The first step is to configue the ecoPython system. I will install scrapy and other tools in my Mac.
  To install scrapy, I need to install Python, Pip and lxml first. The Mac has already installed Python, and  pip is already installed if you're using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org, but you'll need to upgrade pip.
  
  Then it is time to install lxml first. In the terminal, type: pip install lxml.
  
  Install Scrapy. Type: pip install Scrapy.
  
  Done!
