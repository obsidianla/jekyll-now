title: How to configure the ecoPython system
---
  This is my first blog. I plan to write a crawler using python.
  
  To complete this project, I will do three things step by step:
  1. Create a Scrapy project to crawl the content in an Appstore homepage
  2. Save the crawled content in MongoDB
  3. Crawl more content by following next page links
  
  This first blog will describe how to configue the platform to finish this task.

  The first step is to configue the ecoPython system. I will install scrapy and other tools in my Mac.
  To install scrapy, I need to install Python, Pip and lxml first. The Mac has already installed Python, and  pip is already installed if you're using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org, but you'll need to upgrade pip.
  
  Then it is time to install lxml first. In the terminal, type: pip install lxml.
  
  Install Scrapy. Type: pip install Scrapy.
  
  Done!
